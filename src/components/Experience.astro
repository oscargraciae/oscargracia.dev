          <!-- EVAA is a digital platform focused on the creation, distribution, and analysis of surveys. It offers a range of features for collecting and analyzing data, including customizable survey, survey skip logic, response-based alert configurations, and a robust reporting module for effective data visualization. -->
          I developed EVAA, a new customer survey platform. I built the product using modern tech like React, NodeJS, and TypeScript, making sure it was easy to use and worked smoothly for users. EVAA has features like real-time alerts, detailed metrics, customizable surveys, offline response, and a user-friendly mobile app.  A key part of my work was creating a multi-schema system, allowing each organization to have its own separate data within the database, ensuring privacy and customization.
